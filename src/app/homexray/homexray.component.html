            <p>Patients who require an ultrasound scan frequently experience challenges as a result of the scan center's inadequate and filthy infrastructure. Long queues at the center, as well as equally long commutes to get there, compound the situation.</p>

            <p>You can get scanned in the privacy and convenience of your own home, at a time that is convenient for you. Parvathy Homecare is pleased to provide bed-ridden/immobile family members with home-based ultrasound scan services.</p>
